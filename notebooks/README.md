# In the Notebooks Directory
This directory contains the notebooks that have guided my analysis so far:
* [boulder.ipynb](boulder.ipynb): This pertains to analysis on the December 2021 fire in Boulder, CO.
* [mendocino-fire.ipynb](mendocino-fire.ipynb): This pertains to the fire season in 2018, with a focus on looking at mendocino county.
* [mendocino-health.ipynb](mendocino-health.ipynb): Exploratory analysis on health data in mendocino county.

Note that, as of January 2022, the directory structure has been rearranged, and thus references to relative files within these notebooks may be broken. Check the main (../README.md) for guidance. Previously, adherence to a strict directory structure was lazy, and I have tried to reorganize the folders in such a way that everything lives in a predictable place.
